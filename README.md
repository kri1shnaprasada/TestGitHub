FEAR EMOTION RECOGNITION

Emotions are important for every peopleâ€™s life. There are many methodologies available for detecting and also for evaluating the human emotions. Generally the individuals express their emotions using their body language, facial expressions, their voice also using the physiological signals. Emotions are classified as happy, sad, angry, nervousness, fear, surprise etc. Here in this project my aim is to classify the fear emotion in human beings using some machine learning classification techniques. For this work i used an EEG dataset which contains some parameters like valence, arousal, dominance and then i applied machine learning classification techniques for classifying the fear emotion.
